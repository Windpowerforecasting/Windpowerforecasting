    "# Train an image classification model with PyTorch \n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Image classification (or Image recognition) is a subdomain of computer vision in which an algorithm looks at an image and assigns it a tag from a collection of predefined tags or categories that it has been trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vision is responsible for 80-85 percent of our perception of the world, and we, as human beings, trivially perform classification daily on whatever data we come across.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, emulating a classification task with the help of neural networks is one of the first uses of computer vision that researchers thought about.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pytorch\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license.\n",
    "\n",
    "## KMINST dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use the KMINST dataset\n",
    "https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html#torchvision-datasets\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Steps in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps are:\n",
    "- install packages\n",
    "- load dataset, what's train and test loader\n",
    "- print out 1 image from KMINST dataset, with which library, \n",
    "- initiate the NN model, what's neural network, furthor reading: mlu-cv course\n",
    "- train a model with config\n",
    "- test a model \n",
    "- print a figure with train and test loss"
